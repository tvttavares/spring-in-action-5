= Spring in Action 5 Sample Code

This is the sample code for _Spring in Action, Fifth Edition_, by Craig Walls (https://www.manning.com/books/spring-in-action-fifth-edition).

This repository also contains the sample code for _Spring in Action, Sixth Edition_, by Craig Walls (https://livebook.manning.com/book/spring-in-action-sixth-edition).

There is one folder for each chapter in the book--except for chapters 11 and 12, which share a source folder--each containing most or all of the sample code for that chapter.

Starting with Chapter 6, Taco Cloud is broken into a multi-module Maven project.


== IMPORTANT: Lombok

To avoid having to write and maintain what is mostly boilerplate Java code, https://projectlombok.org/[Lombok] is used in all of these examples. When building from the command line, using Maven, you shouldn't encounter any problems, as Lombok is included as part of the build process. But you will very likely encounter issues if you import these projects into your IDE.
